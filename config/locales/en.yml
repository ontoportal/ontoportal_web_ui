        %{site} allows users to browse, upload, download, search, comment on, and create mappings for ontologies.
      browse: >
        Users can browse and explore individual ontologies by navigating either a tree structure or an animated graphical view. Users can also view mappings and 
        ontology metadata, and download ontologies. Additionally, users who are signed in may submit a new ontology to the library.
