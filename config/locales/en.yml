      welcome: Welcome to the National Center for Biomedical Ontology’s %{site}. %{site} is a web-based application for accessing and sharing biomedical ontologies.
      getting_started: >
        %{site} allows users to browse, upload, download, search, comment on, and create mappings for ontologies.
      browse: >
        Users can browse and explore individual ontologies by navigating either a tree structure or an animated graphical view. Users can also view mappings and 
        ontology metadata, and download ontologies. Additionally, users who are signed in may submit a new ontology to the library.

        A class that the authors of the ontology have flagged as being obsolete and which they recommend that people not use. These classes 
        are often left in ontologies (rather than removing them entirely) so that existing systems that depend on them will continue to function.
