    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
    Many vocabularies and ontologies are produced to represent and annotate agronomic data. It is therefore necessary to have a common platform to identify them, host them and use them in agro-informatics applications. The AgroPortal project aims to provide a repository of reference ontologies for agronomy, by reusing the NCBO BioPortal technology. The scientific results and the experience of the biomedical field are thus exploited and transposed in the field of agronomy, including plants, food, the environment and possibly animal sciences. We propose an ontology portal that offers ontology hosting, search, versioning, visualization, commenting, recommendation, allows semantic annotation, as well as storing and exploiting alignments of ontologies. All this in an infrastructure fully compliant with the Semantic Web. The AgroPortal project pays particular attention to meeting the requirements of the agronomic community in terms of ontology formats (e.g. SKOS, trait dictionaries) or supported functionalities. The AgroPortal project is based on five agronomic use cases that participate in the design and orientation of the platform. AgroPortal already offers a robust and stable reference repository, of great value for the field of agronomy.
