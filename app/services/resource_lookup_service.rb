# Resolves an RDF resource - typically a reified definition node - to the
# triples it holds.
#
# The REST API can only serve a resource it has a model for: `instances/:uri`
# needs `rdf:type owl:NamedIndividual`. Six of the twelve AgroPortal
# vocabularies that reify their definitions leave those nodes untyped, so about
# 33,000 definitions - AGROVOC's among them - are invisible to every typed
# endpoint the API exposes. That is structural, not a bug: there is no model to
# serve them under. See doc/reified-definitions-survey.md.
#
# SPARQL has no such requirement, so it answers for a node whatever its type.
# It is used strictly as a fallback - REST first, because it is cheaper and
# returns the API's own view of the resource - and it widens coverage without
# guaranteeing it: an ontology absent from the SPARQL store still resolves only
# if another one shares the node's URI.
